1226	Basically it's part of a wider Active Travel Scheme Nottingham City Council has bid money for. [More info here](https://www.transportnottingham.com/projects/emergency-active-travel-fund-covid-19-measures/)\n\nI am one of way too many contractors involved in putting these in. Some are more popular than others! This one is Woodville Road and some people were quite against it. They are slowly changing their minds though as fewer cars are racing past their house now. It's quite near a busy high street (Mansfield Road) so lots of cars trying to cut through the back streets like this one.

1246	I assume lots of people will write answers so I'll focus on question 1 and try to give a complete answer. First of all though: great post. I like that you're very open minded about this issue.\n\nDisabled people and transport:\nI guess I'll start with the obvious: \n- Lots of disabled people who can't walk long distances, also can't drive them. As you said,you had to drive your parent around for some time, because of their disability. So driving, to me, also seems suboptimal as a solution. \n- The problems for disabled people are usually distance and assistance I would say.\n\nYour parent was obviously relatively lucky to live together with someone who has the time to drive them around. But the paradoxical thing is, that car-centric design actually leads to worse driving conditions. It means sprawl in the outskirts of cities which increase distance and it means traffic jams inside the cities which increase time.This is why dense, non-car-centric cities are actually [much better](https://youtu.be/d8RRE2rDw4k) for drivers. Cars will always have *some* justification. Just far less than people think nowadays.\n\nThe increased time is obviously also a problem for people assisting them as well as cost, which can often be a problem for disabled people who are temporarily or permanently unable to work. If you can just walk for max 5min to the next corner shop to do the groceries like in most of Europe, then more people are abled to help disabled people more.\nThis is even more important for people who don't have a family member to help them. If they live alone in a house, then these people are basically trapped if they can't drive. They either need to pay someone for help, or have very nice neighbours to help them.\nThat's why a flat in a multistory apartment building in a mixed-use (houses and shops combined) area is perfect. Then every task they need help with outside of their home becomes less time consuming and less effort. All that, while having more neighbours that could theoretically help.\n\nSo paid help also needs less time -&gt; costs less and unpaid help has a lower hurdle they need to jump.\n\nAn example from my own experience: With Covid the sick were obviously quarantined (I know, not a disability, but they were unabled to leave the house). I live with two family members in a European village outside of the city. When we had it, getting shopping done was sometimes a hard thing, even though the shops are close. There were basically only 4 households that could help. Meanwhile a lot of my friends from University had it really easy: They live in student homes with dozens of other people. The student homes organized a way of communicating who was quarantined when, and a way to communicate who needs what from the shops. So helping someone usually took a maximum of 5 minutes more, because someone was going to the shops that day anyway.\n\nFor those who can drive:\nMore disabled people can ride a bike (or something similar) than can drive. That's why good cycling infrastructure is vital for disabled people.\nLots of sidewalks are shit for electric wheelchairs and mobility scooters. Bike paths are perfect for them. If disabled people lack the energy to cycle, they can use an e-bike. If they lack the stability, there are bicycle (e-)trikes. If they lack the (use of their) feet, then there are hand-powered bikes/trikes. So mobility scooters are actually a relatively rare sight, because the infrastructure allows disabled people in those cities to get around in a lot more ways. Also: There are [Microcars](https://youtu.be/B9ly7JjqEb0). In American cities it's completley unsafe, but with good cycling infrastructure? Great.\n\nAnd lastly: long-distance travel.\nNothing is more friendly to disabled people than a good train network. Seriously. There's no hassle with boarding a flight, and they have far more room than on a bus or in a car. And travel is a lot less stressful as well.	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/su46k5/this_is_an_interesting_sub_i_like_most_of_the/hx892m2/	2022-02-17 17:38:12	2022-02-17 17:38:12	hx892m2	This is an interesting sub, I like most of the solutions I’ve seen so far, and I wanted to share my story and ask some questions about how certain problems will be solved from the perspective of a pretty young car enthusiast.	active

It has the multiple lanes and is long and straight and has a high speed limit like a road but it also has lots of driveways merging into it like a street.

If you live in Virginia or Maryland off the Metro and you're looking at the profile of someone in Arlington or the District who doesn't have a car then it's reasonable to be put off on the assumption that there's going to be a lopsided amount of you traveling to them.\n\nWhereas in LA you can tell that a lot of people truly assume there's something wrong with you if you don't have a car. Maybe they don't think you have a DUI but maybe they think you're secretly poor, for example. Not necessarily an issue with making friends but I really felt like I was often being grilled on justifying why I didn't have a car and I also felt like it made some girls not want to even get to the point of talking to me for long enough to be able to grill me on it. And even if you got to a first date you would often still sense that they were pretty dubious about you because of your lack of a car.	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/ssfl0a/apparently_if_you_use_public_transportation_you/hwzwo4i/	2022-02-15 17:50:54	2022-02-15 18:56:55	hwzwo4i	Apparently if you use public transportation you don’t have your life together (found on OkCupid)	deleted

986	That's great for your individual situation, but we're talking averages, and I bet you spend more on your car than you think. How much did it cost? Let's say $20,000, and you'll own for for 10 years, that's $2000 a year just for the cost of the car itself. Then add gasoline, license fees, taxes, city stickers, and insurance, and the basics of repairs (if you change your own oil, you still buy and dispose of the oil) and the parts. If you're in an accident, only so much can be repaired at home. Replace the brakes and tires as needed. And even if you say "Nope, I built my car all by myself!" well you still bought materials from somewhere, and you are an extreme exception to the rule -- averages are averages, your frugality is paired with someone's 6 figure vehicle, and we all average out.\n\nI got my numbers from the link below. "Overall, the average annual cost of new vehicle ownership climbed to $9,282, or $773.50 a month."\n\n[https://www.aaa.com/autorepair/articles/average-annual-cost-of-new-vehicle-ownership](https://www.aaa.com/autorepair/articles/average-annual-cost-of-new-vehicle-ownership)	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/stdfz6/impractical_cars_the_cost/hx38zu6/	2022-02-15 22:10:19	2022-02-16 08:11:18	hx38zu6	Impractical Cars: The Cost	deleted

An engine would outlive a battery and be cheaper than lithium. Synthetic fuels would be made out of thin air according to theweek.com .

In one of the major intersections (first and second picture) most of the car lanes are set to disappear.

It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List on account of its wide distribution, its large population, and its presence in a number of protected areas. It is superficially similar to the European pine marten, but differs from it by its smaller size and habitat preferences. While the pine marten is a forest specialist, the beech marten is a more generalist and adaptable species, occurring in a number of open and forest habitats.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/spvlbv/the_icon_changed_what_happened/hwil4bz/	2022-02-11 22:59:53	2022-02-11 23:18:31	hwil4bz	the icon changed..... what happened.	deleted

1211	EPR 1 in France is an over complicated prototype build with German doctrine of operation in mind without the Germans to build it. Terrible design, mismanagement if not corruption at every stage of the process, very few improvement that actually matter. It's a fucking cash-grab. One has been built in Finland and another in China in the meantime so I definitely would not make it a rule of thumb as far as NPP construction goes. For example the Russian seem to be doing alright with their comparable VVER-1200 reactor.\n\nSame goes for long-term/high activity nuclear wastes. Their production mainly revolves around the better than expected availability of U-235 that made the more efficient and complex 4th gen designs developed in the 80s to burn the minor actinides and allow to close the fuel cycle noncompetitive.\n\n_______________________________\n\nThat being said, I cannot disagree completely with you on the matter of cost. I will however point out that [LCOE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levelized_cost_of_energy) is not a good metric to compare the relevance of two distinct energy sources for the grid.\n\nIf your PV or windmill need a backup while your NPP does not, you're comparing apple and oranges. Price of the whole system at the consumer's outlet is what matters. Right now that backup is hydro when possible and gas peaker plant when not. If we do not find a cheap and available storage solution the transition to a fully renewable grid is at a dead-end.\n\nTo be content with betting on "progress" in a market where the investment cycle is 60 years long is completely irresponsible.\n\nEdit: I'm gonna need a source on that x23 CO2eq emissions.

787	Yeah, eminent domain is a tool, an exercise of power by the state. It can be no better than those wielding it are.\n\nHistorically, it has very often been used for bad purposes, frequently the de facto (or even [de jure!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelo_v._City_of_New_London) transfer of wealth from the vulnerable to the powerful.\n\nOn the other hand, the world is ultimately the collective inheritance of all humanity, one which we divide up into private ownership for practical rather than absolute reasons. The people as a whole should be able to rearrange those assignments when needed, and eminent domain can also be put to truly needed public goods.	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/st4qia/transportation_alignment_chart/hx2081j/	2022-02-15 17:50:54	2022-02-15 18:54:12	hx2081j	Transportation alignment chart	deleted
1214	&gt; Mining for lithium is extremely dirty and it can't be recycled. \n\nBoth untrue. Mining is always a little dirty, but lithium is far from the worst materials out there. There are mines in Australia and other countries that have very little environmental impact.\n\nWe can currently recycle 95% of a lithium ion battery ([source](https://electricautonomy.ca/2022/01/28/lithion-commercial-recycling-quebec/)). The reason why recycling isn't really taking off yet is because there are just no batteries to recycle, they're all still running.\n\n&gt; An engine would outlive a battery\n\nNo it wouldn't. Today's batteries can easily last 200,000 miles (source), with [much more promising developments](https://www.wired.com/story/what-happens-after-a-million-mile-battery-outlasts-the-car/) on the horizon.\n\n&gt; Plus if synthetic is expensive, then we will see less auto use and a downsizing of vehicles.\n\nHow likely do you think it is that we can completely eradicate car-dependent suburbs, tear down highways, invest billions over billions into public transportation, rebuild entire cities - all within 10 to 20 years? Because that's what needs to happen if we want to use synthetic fuels.\n\nAnd how likely do you think it is that none of that will happen in sufficient amounts, that most people will still be dependent on cars in 10-20 years and that they will all continue driving with gasoline because nobody can afford synthetic fuels?	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/su19jj/can_we_stop_pretending_like_evs_magically_solve/hx91b0j/	2022-02-17 17:38:12	2022-02-17 17:38:12	hx91b0j	Can we stop pretending like EVs magically solve all the problems created by cars?	active

Focusing on plastic use is a distraction, the real emissions are from big things like transport, industry, military and agriculture. These will take actual effort and will probably inconvenience us a lot to change.\n\nUsing a tote bag instead of a disposable plastic bag might feel good but at the end of the day it makes very little difference.	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/ssnslb/if_i_dont_have_a_car_i_should_be_allowed_plastic/hx0abuy/	2022-02-15 17:50:54	2022-02-15 18:59:27	hx0abuy	If I don't have a car I should be allowed plastic straws.	deleted

590	I know you're trolling, but I'm going to rebut this comment point-by-point for anyone reading who might be swayed by what you've written here.\n\n&gt;I have a right to park my car.\n\nSure, I agree. And we have the right to advocate for replacing those parking spots with bicycle infrastructure.\n\n\n&gt;Bikes are just as dangerous than cars if not more so!\n\nNo the fuck they are not. You don't even need a middle school-level understanding of physics to grasp that being hit by a 2-ton chunk of steel at 40 km/h is exponentially worse than being hit by a bike at 25 km/h (I'm using average speeds to keep things fair here).\n\n&gt;Ask someone who has been hit by a biker (who drive as fast as they possibley can) which one they prefer. Oh wait you can't cause they're DEAD.\n\nThe vast majority of biker-pedestrian collisions do not result in serious injuries, let alone death. And the vast majority of bikers are most certainly *not* traveling "as fast as they possibly can".\n\n\n&gt;Bike lanes ruin pedestrians. You can't cross them because bikes are going over speed limits and cannot brake in time.\n\nWrong. Bike lanes terminate at crossings just like pedestrian sidewalks do, and it's a lot easier to come to a full stop from average bike speed than average car speed. It's also a lot easier to maneuver a bike around a pedestrian to avoid a collision.\n\n&gt;A car will simply stop. No chance for an injury.\n\nTell that to the [30,229 pedestrians who have been killed by cars](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/pedestrians) cars since 2015 in the US alone.\n\n\n&gt;Bikes are bad for the environment\n\nBikes do not run on gasoline, nor do they require an external energy source of any kind.\n\n&gt;10 bikes take more metal than 1 car. At least twice as many carbon.\n\nSo what you're saying is... for the energy cost of one car (probably for use by one person for most of the time), you can produce 10 bikes (for the daily journeys of 10 people), each of which do not require any additional energy to operate.

203	The post is a compendium of old and new photos found throughout the web, showing some of the changes the city has undergone over the course of several decades. A good example that car-centric design is reversible. Some of the before/after comparisons are not taken from the same exact angle, but this is all I could find I am afraid.\n\n**About Burgos**\n\nBurgos is a small city situated in Northern Spain. Like most of the western world, Spain saw unprecedented economic growth during the second half of the twentieth century, which among other things made cars affordable for the masses. This resulted in what you can see in the “old” pictures below – a car-infested city throughout the late 60s, the 70s and 80s.\n\nInitiatives were started in the mid-to-late-90s to pedestrianize some streets around the historical center, which eventually grew to encompass the whole city core. These continued efforts won Burgos the CiViTAs City of the Year in 2007, and the Energy Globe Award in 2008. Urban renewal initiatives continue, and the city has now announced further plans for a 2-sq km Low Emission Zone with further restrictions for motor vehicles.\n\nCredits:\n\n* Santiago Abella - Flickr\n* Archivo Municipal de Burgos\n* Alfredo Gordillo-Pinterest\n* Dionisio Martinez-Pinterest\n* Miguel Angel Muñoz - [verpueblos.com](https://verpueblos.com)\n* Info Turismo Burgos - Twitter\n* Google Maps	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/sq2oi8/burgos_spain_25_years_of_pedestrianization/hwio90q/	2022-02-11 22:59:53	2022-02-12 11:45:13	hwio90q	Burgos, Spain - 25 years of pedestrianization	deleted

484	I am from Prague, city that is very much paved with cobblestones. I have some points that I want to share\n\n* Cobblestones are so much better for rainwater permeability. It is a really big problem in our cities, too much asphalt causes floods and destroys the buildings along the paved surfaces.\n\n* Cobblestone streets still need to be reconstructed from time to time. This is done by pulling the cobblestones out, smoothing the surface underneath and getting them back in. It is really eco-friendly as the cobblestone itself lasts pretty much forever. If you had horrible experience when walking on one, it was probably not worked on for 50+ years. \n\n* You can make a part of the cobblestones biking friendly. This is done by choosing a smaller and smoother stones. [Here is an example of bike path that shares the space with a tram](https://i.imgur.com/D73j6yS.jpg). I use it often, it is not bad ride even on a basic city bike. It would be impossible to roller skate on.	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/sqltgn/this_asphalt_wearing_down_imagine_if_all_city/hwmz8o2/	2022-02-12 13:34:48	2022-02-12 13:35:24	hwmz8o2	This asphalt wearing down.

348	A city that doesn't produce it's own food, is inherently exploitative and capitalism has shown itself to be increasingly inefficient and honestly unworkable.\n\nIf you can only sustain the "efficient" use of space, by shipping food from far away, then it's a very odd definition of "efficient" use of space.\n\nAnyway I was just explaining why many would consider a city with trees "greenwashing", you can (wrongly) disagree with it if you want, but that is the logic of calling it greenwashing.\n\nThis article goes into more detail: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-myth-of-the-sustainable-city/	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/spvobm/barcelonas_plans_to_further_pacify_streets_by/hwkrbfn/	2022-02-12 00:18:25	2022-02-12 02:09:46	hwkrbfn	Barcelona's plans to further pacify streets by next year (before/after)	deleted

That is true, passenger railway services to these places ended in 1980.\n\nSome of the municipalities along the old railway line [would really like to get their trains back](https://www.amoeneburg.de/seite/de/stadt/2635/-/Vorstudie_zur_Ohmtalbahn-Reaktivierung_macht_Hoffnung_auf_Realisierung.html) and have funded a 2021 report to make their case, so perhaps things might change for the better one day…\n\n&gt; Cost between €121 and €163 per person according to the Bahn planner\n\nOf course this entirely depends on *when* you go. If you don’t need to travel right now, you could go [for 39 € tomorrow, for 32 € next week, or for 18 € the week after.](https://bahn.guru/calendar?origin=Berlin+Hbf&amp;destination=Burg-u.+Nieder+Gem%C3%BCnden&amp;submit=Suchen&amp;class=2&amp;bc=2&amp;departureAfter=7%3A30&amp;arrivalBefore=20%3A00&amp;duration=6&amp;maxChanges=) If you do need to travel on very short notice several times a year, the BahnCard 50 is worth it very quickly—then you could even travel *right now* for 71.15 €. More often than not, there are also 10–20 € coupons going around, such as the ones included with some Ferrero products right now, with which you could depart immediately for 61.15 €.	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/spsk4s/electric_train_go_nyoom/hwi4gin/	2022-02-11 22:59:53	2022-02-11 23:16:42	hwi4gin	electric train go nyoom	deleted

452	My favorite cobblestone story is when someone STOLE an entire street of cobblestones in Philadelphia in 1984 in broad daylight.\n[1984: How, and why, did somebody steal Mifflin Street?](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/blogs/real-time/1984-How-and-why-did-somebody-steal-Mifflin-street.html)\n\nIn broad daylight on Nov. 12, 1984, amid the typical hustle and bustle of riverfront warehouses, a small crew of workmen pulled onto a tucked-away South Philadelphia street in a demolition machine.\n\nTruckers and policemen drove by and nodded, assuming that the guys digging up gray-stoned Mifflin Street with a front-end loader were municipal workers. \n\nA nearby shop owner thought the same. But as he watched them work, he developed an uneasy feeling, and then couldn't shake a troubling thought: Why were these men being so cautious with the stones, yet so reckless with the earth below them?\n\nSo he walked over and asked. \n\nJoseph Monkiewicz, an excavator from Montgomery County, told the shop owner that he and his employees were tearing up the old surface so they could lay down a new one. \n\nThe shop owner surveyed the damage and returned to his office, suspicious and puzzled.\n\nSeriously, who steals a street?\n\nStreet crime\n\nThe first block of little East Mifflin Street was one of a few with a signature in that desolate area near the docks. \n\nThe alley-like strip, split by rusty railroad tracks just off Delaware Avenue, was built of big Belgian blocks, cursed by motorists and adored by pedestrians. \n\nThe paving blocks, made from ballast torn out of empty cargo ships, were laid in the mid-1800s.\n\nHow the street caught the eye of Monkiewicz, owner of a demolition company in suburban Glenside, is a mystery. But his motivations were clear.\n\nMonkiewicz was broke.\n\nThe plan was to dig up the stones, stash them at a nearby lot on Oregon Avenue, and truck them in shifts to sell to a North Jersey salvage yard.\n\nFor transportation, he hired Gustav Propper, a waste hauler from Northeast Philadelphia with a criminal record. In the 1970s,  Propper served a jail term for dumping explosive chemicals into a Bensalem Township sewer, and was fined $25 for discarding slime into Pennypack Creek. For a while, he also owned a Bensalem-based demolition firm that in 1974 knocked down a house in Northern Liberties and killed a woman in the house next door. \n\nAll told, Monkiewicz's crew ripped up 16,300 pavers before the shopkeeper finally called the city, which called in the police. \n\nThe stones were worth about $4 a pop, but Monkiewicz sold them for $1 each. The entire haul was worth more than $65,000. (In 2016, it translates to about $150,000.)\n\nInvestigators, suspecting a sophomoric prank, were shocked when they arrived at the scene and found "a giant dirt hole." Only tire treads and about 40 feet of the paving blocks remained.\n\n\nThe pockmarked earth looked more like a dried-out riverbed than a former city street.\n\nRoadblocks\n\nInvestigators raided the vacant lot on Oregon Avenue, and found a man who said he was paid $500 to watch the loot between trips. After gathering further information, police found and arrested 35-year-old Monkiewicz and 49-year-old Propper.\n\nThe city only recovered about 4,000 blocks from the salvage yard, which claimed no knowledge of the theft. While Monkiewicz did not provide any interviews, the Inquirer noted that the salvage yard often sold to New York developers, speculating that Mifflin Street ended up spread out across the patios of Long Island.\n\nThree years later, Propper was acquitted of all charges. He maintained he wasn't told the blocks were stolen. That same year, Monkiewicz pleaded guilty to theft and conspiracy, but Common Pleas Court Judge Thomas Watkins offered him a deal: two years' probation if he repaved the street.\n\n\nImmediately, though, he hit roadblocks.\n\nFirst, the city didn't trust him to do the job. So Monkiewicz hired a subcontractor, which cost him about $20,000. Then, they ran into cold weather -- apparently, it has to be at least 40 degrees to pave a street.\n\nOnce, the subcontractor brought in equipment, graded the block, and prepared for the pouring of blacktop. And then a water main broke, flooding the street.\n\nLater, Monkiewicz got a taste of his own medicine: Someone had dug a new hole.  "I found the street dug up," Monkiewicz told the court. "There was a big, deep hole in the street."\n\nThe kicker: The city couldn't figure out if real municipal workers were responsible for the new hole.\n\nMonkiewicz's defense attorney wrote a letter to the city asking for an explanation, but the city didn't have an answer.\n\nWatkins couldn't understand how the city didn't know whether its own employees were working on Mifflin Street -- a path that the city contended "was a historical, valuable part of our city."\n\nConfounded, Watkins added: "Mr. Monkiewicz apparently brought this to their attention!"	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/sqltgn/this_asphalt_wearing_down_imagine_if_all_city/hwmq3vp/	2022-02-12 11:02:19	2022-02-12 11:03:00	hwmq3vp	This asphalt wearing down.

176	Thinking of a short outline of a bigger plan, I propose cultural/political changes, AKA a Responsible Transportation Reform Act.\n\n\\- Abolish the term "car accident/incident". Call 'em collisions, or whatever's more accurate.\n\n\\- Make drivers and car owners take responsibility for what's done in their car.\n\n\\- Classify driving a private car, as the sole occupant, as a luxury and tax it.\n\n\\- Systemize an allowance to low income working class who travel to their place of employment.\n\n\\- Make road users pay for infrastructure according to their vehicle weight and distance traveled.\n\n\\- Abolish parking requirements for new construction.\n\n\\- Road worthiness check-ups for new and irresponsible road users.\n\n\\- Ditch the suburban zoning and car-centric requirements, in order to allow medium-sized apartments.\n\nAn honor system, in which individuals declare these things, should be enough. Shouldn't need to be closely monitored and enforced. Let computers audit the records. Again, it's the responsibility of drivers to prove their word as accurate, if there are issues found from auditing. Allow citizen complaints with proof to be submitted to record-keeping.\n\nCut taxes (property, state, and fed). Property taxes should be based more proportional to the quality of its land, the infrastructure access, and service burden, rather than its resale value. Should basically cover all the access roads, utility hook-ups, proximity to police, fire, EMT response teams, and basically represent location value. If a new train line gets built next to an existing business, that land plot's property tax will increase more than those further away.\n\nMaybe at the same time, adopt nationwide VAT-style sales tax to products and services, to simplify up-front costs. Adopt a waste/pollution tax system too, paid by the creators in order to compensate those who deal with it (e.g. product packaging waste).\n\nThis should revive the competitiveness of shopping local, if logistics services are passing costs to consumers. Should also encourage those on prime real estate to rent out to those who'd pay worthy rent, who'd make better use of the location. They'd be encouraged to expand the building vertically, to accept more tenants to spread the property tax burden. This should make suburban property tax costs per person seem more costly in comparison to urban, due to the lack of sharing.\n\nCan still be toll roads, but for expressways that don't accommodate slower multi-modal traffic. Tolls would basically make people compare them to mass transit ticket fees, and count as a luxury alternative. Mass transit can implement luxury seating and reservations as options too.\n\nEmployers can choose to house their employees in a business campus to waive the need to pay the low-income travel allowance, to compete on their bottom line.\n\nFound that the EPA already makes a lot of the suggestions I had in mind:\n\nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-01/documents/2009\\_essential\\_fixes\\_0.pdf	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/spmlxi/sorry_but_this_is_why_im_not_a_libertarian/hwi6v61/	2022-02-11 22:59:53	2022-02-14 12:22:11	hwi6v61	Sorry but this is why I'm not a Libertarian...	deleted

605	&gt;the original idea for the Hyperloop was a train-type pod that could travel at supersonic speeds in a vacuum tube, which was a somewhat decent idea.\n\nThe thing is that the Hyperloop doesn't do a good job of doing that which has already been done more efficiently in other ways.\n\nJapan has had high-sped rail on the Shinkansen network for over 50 years, and the majority of it uses more traditional standard-gauge, continuously-welded rail and is incredibly reliable.\n\nAlso [as pointed out in one Adam Something's recently videos on the topic (specifically about the "HyperPort" cargo concept, but also applies to passenger services)](https://youtu.be/dNzjk-kiUmQ), if a single part of a hyperloop system loop's infrastructure was to fail, whether due to an unintentional mechanical failure or due to deliberate sabotage, the entire loop would be taken offline and become unusable due to the loss of vacuum pressure and pods stuck inside of the remains of the tube(s) would be insanely costly and it would be impossible to reroute any pods before they entering the resulting wreckage, whereas in a traditional rail system, a train could be stopped and potentially make its way to it's destination or make a detour via an alternative route.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;A pipe dream? Probably.\n\nA pipe dream is the perfect way to sum up the entire Hyperloop idea. It is a literal vacuum sealed pipe-dream of a train system dreamt up by an e-money Billionaire/electric cars salesman who bought a car company and conned the city of Las Vegas out of $50M for a few glorified underground roads and some of his cars.	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/sqtzpe/space_of_1_tesla_space_of_10_bikes/hwpzwle/	2022-02-13 15:25:20	2022-02-13 15:34:49	hwpzwle	Space of 1 Tesla = Space of 10 bikes	deleted

(Road transport is responsible for 12% of total emissions.)\n\nAlso the higher the speed, the higher the crash risk.

595	Lots of fantastic answers here. However, in addition to everything you've heard thus far, here's what you should do in order to maximize your impact:\n\n#Form a group!\n\nThis is so important! Recruit other people to help your cause. Get the school's approval to form a club, and if you can't, then do it on your own time. Tell your friends that if they participate regularly, and if your work ends up producing meaningful change, it's something that would look great on their university applications.\n\n- If you or someone you know is good at graphic design, make some flyers! Create an Instagram page!\n- During meetings, showcase a YouTube video from the likes of NotJustBikes, RM Transit, City Beautiful, and others. Discuss whether or not these ideas would work in your own town, and what may need to be different. Then decide what you actually want to advocate for - starting with small stuff like [continuous sidewalks](https://youtu.be/9OfBpQgLXUc) and working your way up to significant changes like permanent bike paths segregated by concrete barriers.\n- Encourage participation by handing out treats or doing small giveaways!\n- Meet with your city councillors as a group, or choose a representative(s) to speak on your behalf.\n- And most importantly, direct your members to recruit new members, who then recruit new members and so on!	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/sqpc7l/what_can_a_highschooler_do_to_promote/hwo55v6/	2022-02-12 17:54:30	2022-02-12 17:56:23	hwo55v6	What can a high-schooler do to promote pedestrian-friendly urban design?	deleted

662	I face these monsters almost daily crossing the street as a I walk to and from my office.  It's difficult not to suspect that there is active disdain or contempt for pedestrians.  \n\nThe escalating size and threat posed by these vehicles has characteristics of an arms race.  The contemporary sports utility vehicle is a menace and lurking weapon of terror against pedestrians.  They're essentailly designed to jump curbs, meanwhile the law is not very well designed to constrain their abuses and the police seem to prefer that any laws that might do so go uneforced, probably because the police prefer to indulge in such abuses themselves.  \n\nAt least [one of their characteristic design features](https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/car-design/a33490594/suv-chins-dodge-regulations/) evidently arises from evasion of 'inconvenient' regulations.	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/sqzmd8/in_2020_and_2021_8_of_the_top_10_best_selling/hwqftwd/	2022-02-13 15:25:20	2022-02-13 15:52:08	hwqftwd	In 2020 and 2021, 8 of the top 10 best selling vehicles were trucks and SUV's	deleted

597	That is a pretty complete argument but they need to go deeper. The authors quanitified the value of free parking because of land value, but ignored the land value of roadways. This stat alone would more then double the estimated costs. \n\nThe other aspects that need yo be addressed is the cost of burning away a finite resource like oil and the loss of raw materials that go into a car. The cost of these items are made with a mindset of the current supply. there is not an endless supply of these items so you need to price in the fact that people in the future are desiring these materials. If you do not do this, you are stealing from future generations. \n\nThe air related pollution costs are also absurdly low when you factor in the long term destruction caused.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.vtpi.org/tca/tca0514.pdf&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwje38KLxvr1AhUqIkQIHUbpD00QFnoECAIQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw049cjendLUeJRrcZf3OqOZ	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/sqi5d5/what_is_the_true_cost_of_car_ownership/hwnq8tf/	2022-02-12 17:54:30	2022-02-12 17:54:30	hwnq8tf	What Is the True Cost of Car Ownership?	deleted
614	Everything needs maintenance - that's just how infrastructure works. But maintaining this tiny piece of cycleway is waaaay easier and cheaper than maintaining a 4 lane car road bridge and the related parking lots to got along with it. It's not a question of magically making maintenance disappear - it's a question of having to maintain a city as little as possible, so it becomes affordable.

The photo is courtesy of [this LiveJournal post](https://gelio.livejournal.com/261655.html) (it's in Russian, but the text is mostly fluff anyway, the main draw is the pretty pictures).

1249	"What about disabled people?" Amsterdam, our golden role model of being free from car addiction, allows persons with disabilities to use [microcars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9ly7JjqEb0&amp;ab_channel=NotJustBikes) to get around. They are even permitted in the bike lanes.\n\n"What about US sprawl?" The spread of US development is not because of farmland. I wish it were. Go to Google Maps in the Netherlands, and you'll see abrupt shifts from San Francisco density to farmland. Each space is dedicated to its purpose. For solutions, Maybe some areas will allow nature to reclaim them, but realistically, I think this won't happen much. More realistically, the solution for suburbs is to have "horizontal mixed-use zoning." Where a grocery store for example is allowed to be in the middle of a neighborhood. And there must be a comprehensive biking network. US streets are so wide, it would be easy to add this. Pedestrian/bike paths connecting cul-de-sacs and tracing behind properties are also quite nice.\n\n"How to make transit woman-friendly?" Here in Indonesia, we have dedicated areas on buses and trains that are [woman-only](https://rm.id/config/thumbnail.php?file=../images/berita/med/penumpang-transjakarta-tak-sadar-naik-bus-zhongtong_20390.jpg&amp;width=739&amp;height=385). The front and back car of a train, and the front section of a bus is used for that. On our Bus Rapid Transit system, the doors are in the middle and back, so men have no reason to pass through even to get on and off. Each BRT stop has an attendant as well. I also believe that removing car-dependence will push society towards less "anomia," so wild outbursts in public will be less common.\n\n"How do we get the public to agree?" That's what this movement is about. Unlike breast cancer, awareness \\*is\\* the solution. Aware people vote for aware people and go to city council meetings and change happens a little bit at a time over the course of decades.	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/su46k5/this_is_an_interesting_sub_i_like_most_of_the/hx8r0wm/	2022-02-17 17:38:12	2022-02-17 17:38:12	hx8r0wm	This is an interesting sub, I like most of the solutions I’ve seen so far, and I wanted to share my story and ask some questions about how certain problems will be solved from the perspective of a pretty young car enthusiast.	active

Despite federal court mandates prohibiting blatant racial and economic discrimination, many of these less fortunate groups have encountered systematic obstacles preventing access to higher-income areas. Studies have demonstrated that higher-income and predominately-white jurisdictions generally adopt more restrictive land-use regulations. As a result, minority and lower-income groups are essentially locked into rigidly segregated neighborhoods.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/ssagky/50_years_ago_same_bullshit/hwxcny8/	2022-02-14 16:55:23	2022-02-14 17:09:18	hwxcny8	50 years ago, same bullshit	deleted

1129	"Young people today overwhelmingly want to live in walkable urban neighborhoods" this is unfortunately not true in america. young people, e.g. the 18-29 demo, do enjoy urban life more than other demos, but overwhelmingly most americans, including young americans, want suburbs according to polls\n\nheres some recent polling on it (scroll down to "31% of adults ages 18 to 29 would prefer to live in a city"): https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2021/12/16/americans-are-less-likely-than-before-covid-19-to-want-to-live-in-cities-more-likely-to-prefer-suburbs/\n\nin terms of walkability, its also a bit of a blow out in favor of the status quo. there is some nuance here tho, with asians being the only racial group wanting a more walkable community than a bigger home and liberals preferring walkability by a small margin: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/26/more-americans-now-say-they-prefer-a-community-with-big-houses-even-if-local-amenities-are-farther-away/	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/st85jj/electric_cars_are_here_to_save_the_car_industry/hx4k2t3/	2022-02-16 11:01:06	2022-02-16 11:15:36	hx4k2t3	Electric cars are here to save the car industry not the planet.	deleted

If you sell pizza that is made poorly, cheaply and quickly - and is burnt - you shouldn’t draw the conclusion that nobody wants pizza. The reality is that nobody wants *bad* pizza.\n\nThe same principals apply to public transit: good public transit is fantastic and everybody loves it. But bad public transit sucks, is not useful if it doesn’t serve the community and few people will use it. Cities that half-ass public transit and cut corners should not act surprised when they end up with a system nobody wants to use.	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/srx2v7/it_is_an_endless_cycle/hwvoj4w/	2022-02-14 16:55:23	2022-02-14 17:18:58	hwvoj4w	It is an endless cycle	deleted

It has enormous social, economic, environmental, aesthetic and historical drawbacks. I deeply hate it and it makes my life so notably worse. \n\nThe problems of the streets were compounded by the[ Blanka car tunnel complex entrance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanka_tunnel_complex) nearby. This raised the number of cars per day to over 100,000, exceeding both emission and noise limit. Let me tell you, it is immediately noticeable.\n\nThere are no pedestrian-oriented businesses, including a single pub (really bizzare occurence in Prague).

797	This whole idea doesn't make much sense.\n\nI can't find the article right now but I remember that cyclists actually produce a significant amount of CO2 which mostly depends on their diet. It was around 21g/km for a typical western diet, over 500g/km for a purely beef-based (crazy) diet and basically nothing (~1g/km) for vegans. Manufacturing of the bicycle (e-bike or not) is negligible, so for the average person riding an e-bike produces less CO2 than riding a normal bicycle.\n\nFor comparison a typical ICE car produces 250g/km and the best case scenario for an EV is currently at around 50g/km over its lifetime.\n\nBut as you can see taxing cycling itself doesn't make sense, you have to tax food production. This also ignores all other externalities, some of which (e.g. improved health) are positive in case of the bicycle.\n\nEdit: sources\n\n- https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/cycling-environmental-impact/\n- https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Global-LCA-passenger-cars-jul2021_0.pdf	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/st2wvu/i_believe_community_must_support_bizarre_idea_of/hx1c9d7/	2022-02-15 17:50:54	2022-02-15 19:19:29	hx1c9d7	I believe community must support bizarre idea of cyclist CO2 tax suggested by Ed Orcutt in 2013	deleted

708	Video mentions neither the Koch Bros. nor John Birch Society. Interesting video, but I'm not sure that opponents of safe streets, walkable cities, and public transit really lean on this too much. I've never heard of this in the many many screeds against smart growth initiatives. \n\nAlso mind you, the people I hear opposing things like bike lanes, new apartment buildings, and increased transit funding are overwhelmingly liberal (this is Washington DC). They're less likely to bring up Glenn Beck, and instead compare infill development of an empty lot to [Palestinian resistance of Israeli occupation.](https://dcist.com/story/16/01/11/photos-a-secret-party-underneath-mc/) \n\nThat's not even getting into the accusations that doing anything anywhere leads to gentrification. A recent anti-bike lane meeting said bike lanes would cause gentrification, but also destroy businesses and cause people's property values to plummet.	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/ss91al/how_the_koch_bros_and_john_birch_society_helped/hwx9jix/	2022-02-14 16:55:23	2022-02-14 17:22:56	hwx9jix	How The Koch Bros. and John Birch Society helped block city-wide implementation of bike lanes and public transit in the 2010s by funneling billions into a conspiracy theory called "UN Agenda 21" that became the basis for QAnon, CRT, and other modern conspiracy theory movements.	deleted
897	This thread, which I linked to when this chart was posted on this sub *less than a fucking week ago* explains it https://twitter.com/PaulABarter/status/1468414864716558341\n\nDensity and energy use is calculated based on urban built up land for the entire metro area (except in some cases where it's only for the core city). The density in particular is based on "net urban density" which is not a very common statistic to see since it's hard to calculate, even though more accurate.\n\nThe population dots being sized to the core city was not part of the original data, and is a misleading bit of information added when the chart was created.	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/sswt7s/how_transport_energy_per_capita_and_population/hx35ma1/	2022-02-15 22:03:21	2022-02-16 08:16:11	hx35ma1	How transport energy per capita and Population density correlate.	deleted

I think maybe more staff like security is the answer. People trained and equipped to confront situations like that. I don’t want my safety to depend on random passengers.\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n“Eventually, a transportation authority employee got on the train, saw what was happening and called 911, Mr. Busch said. Then, a “police officer ran onto the train and caught this man in the act and took him into custody,” Mr. Busch said.\n\nThe surveillance footage that the authorities are reviewing does not contain audio, Mr. Bernhardt said. But based on the footage that he had reviewed, it was clear that passengers had an opportunity to intervene, he said.”	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/su46k5/this_is_an_interesting_sub_i_like_most_of_the/hx8junl/	2022-02-17 17:38:12	2022-02-17 17:38:12	hx8junl	This is an interesting sub, I like most of the solutions I’ve seen so far, and I wanted to share my story and ask some questions about how certain problems will be solved from the perspective of a pretty young car enthusiast.	active

1250	Only recently did I actually learn about the downsides and environmental pollution......People post stuff about pedestrian sidewalks and cyclist safety and emissions and traffic and it shocked me because I realized that I’ve been fighting this stuff, too.  \n\\---Important to note that there are a wide variety of issues from car-filled cities. Environmental harm is only one of them.  There's isolation from other people, searching for parking, noise, neighborhoods empty of life, oil leaking into drinking water, and even things like heart attacks.  \na suburb that HAS NO SIDEWALKS and refused to let me drive the car they own...It’s dangerous to bike on a 50 mph road without a bike lane! The nearest stores are 2 miles away! That leaves me isolated with an abusive parent....I told that parent as I moved out that it is not natural or healthy for human beings to be isolated with only long roads between us and the world.  \n\\---This sadly is the situation for so many people. Cars don't actually bring freedom. They isolate us from our neighbors, potential friends, potential boyfriends, and as you mention, these highways make it impossible to go to the store (ironically business owners fight for more parking b/c they think customers mainly arrive by car).  \nWhen I learned to drive, I was told by three different surprised instructors that I was the best driver they’d seen....I do everything right every time (no distractions..). But....shouldn’t that be the most basic standard?....  \n\\---Yes, it \\*\\*should\\*\\* be.  But sadly many of us without drivers licenses (raises hand) are better drivers then people behind the wheel because it's a simple matter of survival.  I personally consider it a near miracle if someone in a car stops at a stop sign or Xwalk.  I appreciate that you take being in a vehicle seriously, but you are definitely the exception.  \nWhy are these driving skills not the bare minimum? That’s just irresponsible, terrifying, etc.  \n\\---As far as I know, people are not tested after the first license all through adulthood.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  \nI know a couple really avid cyclists. One, my ex-boyfriend, has lasting brain damage because he got hit by a car.... I have never biked on a road that I have to share and I plan to keep it that way. Emissions are bad but I won’t have anything but concrete between me and the very real brain damage that happens all the time to cyclists.  \n\\---I'm sorry to hear that you're intimidated. You could join other local groups fighting for better protection. I've read far too many stories about people getting hurt and I moved a few times trying to find a city without deadly traffic.  \nWhat should we do about disabled people, or people with bad physical health?  \n\\---Most other people have already answered this. So I'll just linked to the site that I wrote - http://towardzeroimpact.net/CCC/CCC-benefits.php#section-handicap  \nWhat about countries like Canada and the US? They are spread apart by nature...  \n\\---N. America really isn't as spread apart as ppl think. If you look at China, it's about as large and they have a huge train system. U.S. is mostly spread apart by suburbs. (see Strongtowns on YouTube) Yes it would take yrs to build trains. But there are also dense cities here like Montreal, Vancouver, NY, Boston, and Toronto.  If we think about it, people just have the \\*expectation\\* that traveling 100s of miles is a RIGHT.  But 200yrs ago people didn't travel so much.  That's what I do.  I take bike trips out to the mountains, but I don't go across the country very much.  \nHow do we make public transit more woman-friendly? I’m female, living in a medium big American city with the usual crime, and I refuse to get on the train because of several sexual harassment incidents.... I use buses very often, trying to do my part, but my family has a rule that I agree with where I don’t do so after dark... It’s scary! It just doesn’t happen in cars which sucks. Its also not reliable, time wise...  \n\\---First of all, I would say that the risk of assault is not missing with car culture. Women have been car-jacked at gas stations or assaulted. If you sit in a traffic jam then you're literally a prisoner and anybody could attack you.  It might be less likely on a crowded bus but I don't know as I almost never use transit (takes longer then biking).  Maybe having some kind of personal protection would be a good idea.  \nLast question: how do we ever get the public to agree with this?  \n\\---That's the million dollar question. The American public seems to be hugely susceptible to media manipulation (think about all the wars we have). Media constantly shows ppl using the bus or bike as \\*losers\\* and ppl in cars as \\*successful\\* even though the latter costs $9000/yr.	https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/su46k5/this_is_an_interesting_sub_i_like_most_of_the/hxabuun/	2022-02-17 17:38:12	2022-02-17 17:38:12	hxabuun	This is an interesting sub, I like most of the solutions I’ve seen so far, and I wanted to share my story and ask some questions about how certain problems will be solved from the perspective of a pretty young car enthusiast.	active
